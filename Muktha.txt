===========
https://www.javatpoint.com/corejava-interview-questions

1 : what is encapsulation
2 : what is polymorphism?types and usage of it?
3 : what is abstraction?when to use it?try to revisse all
4 : what is interface?
5 : difference between abstract and interface
6 : what is variable declared in interface?is it final and static
7 : what is inheritance
8 : what is constructor
9 : what is this,this(),super,super(),final,static
10 : what is coding at interface ?and how is it implemented?try to relate with polymorphism
11 : Is java call be value or call by reference
12 : Explain upcasting and downcasting in java?which casting does java does automatically


Exception Handling
=========
1 : what is try,catch finally
2 : throw ,throws
3 : how to write custom exception class?what u have to implement?


Collection Questions
===========
Note :Maintain presence of MIND and silence
==
1 : Each question u study pictorial representation(like object and reference ).Either u write or find in java t point or beginnersbook or google search
2 : check methods in arraylist,hashmap,treeMap and etc(study from java t point)
3 : what is Collection and Collections ?which is interface and which is class ?what all methods are there in class
4 : In which package collection is present
5 : will Map comes in Collections??
6 : Understand which are interface in collection and Map


HashMap:
======
1 : put string values in hashmap
2 : put custom objects in hashmap
3 : sort hashmap for string values
4 : sort hashmap for custom objects values
5 : can we add custom object reference as key
6 : can we sort custom object reference in keys
7 : how many ways u can iterate values (eg:for each,iterator and any other??)write programs to each iterate
8 : how hashmap works internally(i will explain)


TreeMap:
========
1 : what is treeMap?
2 : difference between hashmap and treeMap
3 : add  keys as strings  and  values also as string in treeMap
4 : print treeMap values.check will it print keys in ascending order
5 : add keys as custom object reference atleast 2 and check any exception
6 : add keys as string and values as custom object reference and print it.
7 : will treeMap sort keys or values
8 : how will u sort treeMap based on values

SET
====

HashSet :
=====
1 : what is hashset?
2 : will it allow duplicate elements
3 : will hashset sort elements
4 : sort hashset in descending order

TreeSet  :
======== 

1 : what is treeset?
2 : what is difference between treeset and hashset
3 : will it allow duplicate elements
4 : display elements of iterate

List:
====

ArrayList:
======
1 : what is arraylist?
2 : difference between array and arraylist

LinkedList : 
=====
1 : what is LinkedList?
2 : What is Node in linkedlist? is it class ??
3 : If LinkedList has Node class?then what all fields it has?
4 : What is single linked list and double linkedlist
5 : which is single list and double linked list in java?

comparable and comparator
=======
1 : what is comparable ? is it interface?which method is present in this interface
2 : what is comparator ? is it interface?which method is present in this interface
3 : sort  string and custom object using compare and comparator
4 : difference between comparable and comparator
5 : when will u use comparable and comparator

MISC in collection:
============
0 : Explain basic about synchronization and non-synchronization and then implementation on arraylist
		note : seperate example without synchronization,concurrentModificationExample and etc
		https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/synchronization-arraylist-java/
1 : Explain concurrentModificationExample with and without exception and how to handle it (myself to explore  more)
		https://www.journaldev.com/378/java-util-concurrentmodificationexception
2 : what is fail-fast and fail-safe 
3 : Explain Iterator problem : i,e when iterating object(say arraylist),if someother thread  modifies structure(adding or deleting) on same arraylist Object,
		then we get conurrentModification exception(refer : ArrayListSynchronization) :
		1 : To overcome this use either for,forloop to display list 
		2 : or make iterating method as synchronization when u use Collections.synchronizatedList
		3 : or use CopyOnwriteArrayList : it gives copy while modfying

Object class
=======
1 : what is object class
2 : what are methods are present in Object class
3 : Is all class are child of Object class
4 : when to override below methods with example
		a) equals, hashcode ,tostring(),compareto,
	
	
	
Serialization
======
1 : what is serialization?
2 : what is deserialization?
3 : what if i dont want serializae particular field??transient or static or both we can use
4 : what is serial version in serialization?
5 : How will u make class as serialziable?
6 : what is marker interface?is serializable interface is marker?
7 : 

Serialization :Mainly focus on state of Object
==============
1 : Explain serialization of my git hub example

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-serialization-inheritance-java/#:~:text=Serialization%20is%20a%20mechanism%20of,object%20into%20a%20byte%20stream.&text=So%20we%20can%20say%20that,during%20serialization%20in%20this%20case.

1 : If super class implements serialzable,then child class is also serialzable without implementing it

2 : If a superclass is not serializable then subclass can still be serialized

3 : If the superclass is serializable but we donâ€™t want the subclass to be serialized : override write and read object and throw exception in child class
